# Business Context - AML Investigation Portal

## A. Industry context (BFSI pressures)

Regulatory expectations: demonstrable, auditable transaction monitoring + case management; explainable decisions; model risk governance (SR 11-7), BSA/AML, CTR/SAR obligations.

Ops reality: large alert volumes, high false positives, strict SLAs, examiner-ready audit trails, and continuous model validation.

## B. Customer pain points (what we're solving)

- Manual investigation overload (hours per case, repetitive evidence gathering).
- False positives and poor prioritization (low SAR conversion).
- Fragmented systems (payments, KYC, sanctions, adverse media, historical SARs).
- Weak explainability + audit readiness (hard to prove rationale end-to-end).
- Model drift / governance (validation schedules, champion/challenger, approvals).
- Infra cost opacity (inference cost, CPU/GPU usage, latency vs SLA).
