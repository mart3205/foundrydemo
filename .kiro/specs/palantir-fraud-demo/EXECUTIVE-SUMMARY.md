# Topic: Palantir Foundry for Enterprise Fraud & Risk Intelligence

Palantir Foundry transforms fragmented fraud detection into unified, explainable, and operational intelligence.

## The Problem: Fragmented Risk Intelligence

Financial institutions like XYZ Bank struggle with disconnected fraud systems across Core Banking, CRM, Device Monitoring, and Payment Processors. This results in:

**High Costs:** 60% false positive rates, 2-4 hour investigations, $2M+ annual fraud losses

**Operational Drag:** Manual cross-checking across 5+ systems, invisible fraud rings, slow detection

**Risk:** Black-box AI fails regulatory requirements (GDPR, FCRA, ECOA), no unified customer view, manual compliance reporting

## The Solution: Foundry-Driven Operational Intelligence

Palantir Foundry transforms fraud detection through four pillars:

**1. Unified Data Integration**
Connects disconnected systems into a single governed data fabric with full lineage and audit trails.

**2. Ontology-Based Network Intelligence**
Models Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Devices, and Cases as connected entities, revealing fraud patterns invisible in traditional systems (shared devices, merchant concentration, cross-border rings).

**3. Explainable Risk Scoring**
Transparent, auditable rules explain WHY each transaction is flagged. Every decision is traceable to source data, meeting regulatory requirements.

**4. Operational Actions & AI-Assisted Investigation**
Investigators escalate cases, freeze accounts, and ask AI: "Summarize why this customer is high risk" or "Draft a compliance report." AI responses are grounded in governed data—no hallucinations.

## The Impact

**Results:**
- 80% faster investigations (2-4 hours → <30 minutes)
- 67% fewer false positives (60% → <20%)
- 10x faster fraud ring detection (weeks → minutes)
- $2M+ annual fraud loss prevention

**Transformation:**
From fragmented alerts → unified operational intelligence
From black-box AI → explainable, audit-ready decisions
From reactive detection → proactive fraud prevention

**XYZ Bank does not lack fraud detection tools. It lacks connected, governed intelligence.**

## Why Not Traditional Fraud Systems?

**Rule Engines:** Static, 60%+ false positives, manual updates
**Graph Databases:** No governance, lineage, or audit trails
**BI Tools:** Dashboards only—no operational actions
**ML Models:** Black-box, fail regulatory explainability requirements

**Foundry Differentiators:** Governed data integration + Ontology-based intelligence + Operational workflows + Explainable AI

This is not analytics. This is operational intelligence.

## Demo: The Golden Path (15-20 minutes)

ONE compelling fraud story demonstrates everything:

**A suspicious transaction from a high-risk country → linked to a shared device → escalated to investigation → explained by AI**

**6 Steps:**
1. Show disconnected data (4 CSV files)
2. Show ontology graph (5 connected objects)
3. Visualize network (shared device → 5 accounts)
4. Explain risk score (3 transparent rules)
5. Take action (escalate case, freeze account)
6. Ask AI ("Summarize risk" + "Draft report")

**Build time: 8-13 days. Maximum impact.**
